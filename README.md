App Idea
MindFrame will be an app that joins the greatest features of productivity apps like Notion and social apps like Instagram and TikTok. MindFrame will put concentrated attention on improving mental well-being and personal growth through creative journaling and goal tracking.

Features to implement:

A daily mood tracker with guided prompts and space for freeform journaling, similar to Instagram Stories, but private to the user unless shared.
Habit-building interactive challenges, like setting up a trend on TikTok, which build positive habits and enhance productivity. Notion-like custom layouts for organizing personal growth goals, gratitude logs, and vision boards. The in-app anonymous community shares your progress and helps to encourage or gets inspired. The goal of this app is to combine productivity, creativity, and community in support of holistic personal development.
